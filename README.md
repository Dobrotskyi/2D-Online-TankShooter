# Multiplayer WebGL 2D-TankShooter
This project was built for a portfolio.

This is a multiplayer top-down 2D tank shooter that you can play via link https://tankshooter.000webhostapp.com/  
To play this game you need to have a keyboard and mouse and some friends.  
Game supports up to 4 players on a game server.  
Goal of this game is very simple, you just hop in on a server with your friends and decide who is the best player in a battle.

For this project I used such technologies as PUN 2, phpMyAdmin, MAMP.

You can find some videos of me playing this game here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNsXzEtM8Mk&list=PLEptj_XTzOPVYy_SENyvTgKJ5POnSLMHS&ab_channel=ValeriiDobrotskyi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEptj_XTzOPVYy_SENyvTgKJ5POnSLMHS)
